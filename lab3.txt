Question 1: What is the link to your github repository for this lab?
https://github.com/maraf-dev/404lab3Django

Question 2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?
a “Congratulations!” page, with a rocket taking off. 

Question 3: After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?
navigating to / shows a page not found, but navigating to /polls shows the 'Hello, world. You're at the polls index.' message

Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?
A migration is a file that contains instructions for django to modify the database scheme, 
and we need them to reflect the models' changes on the database

Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? From a high levle, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?
I see the authorized groups and users, and the dataset of choice and question tables. 
To see the custom models in the admin page, we need to register the models in the admin.py file.

Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? 
What happens when you don’t put a number, and instead use a string? 
How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?
/polls/38/: You're looking at question 38. /polls/38/results: You're looking at the results of question 38. 
/polls/38/vote: You're voting on question 38. using a string gives a page not found error. we can modify the url to allow string input 
by using path('<str:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'), instead.
